### Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE7 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application. 

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE7/tree/main/00_Setting%20Up%20Git)!

#### How AIM Does Assignments
Throughout our time together - we'll be providing a number of assignments. Each assignment can be split into two broad categories:

- Base Assignment - a more conceptual and theory based assignment focused on locking in specific key concepts and learnings.
- Hardmode Assignment - a more programming focused assignment focused on core code-concepts.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓Questions - these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!
- 🏗️ Activities - these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.
- 🚧 Advanced Builds - these will only appear in Hardmode assignments, and will require you to build something with little to no help outside of documentation!

##### 🏗️ Activity #1:

Please evaluate your system on the following questions: (answers are directly below)

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner. 
    - Aspect Tested:
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested:
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested:
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested:
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested:

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

##### 🚧 Advanced Build:

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check done above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

### Submitting Your Homework
## 🚀 AIE7 Assignment 1 Submission

- [Reflection & Results (activities.md)](https://github.com/BQ31X/Revamped-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/advanced-build/activities.md)
- [Loom Video](https://www.loom.com/share/d6e99c269d4245e0a48db286a9cabf1e?sid=2383b87a-3a30-41f2-82de-cb8c7b2dbdaf)
- [Advanced Build Branch](https://github.com/BQ31X/Revamped-AI-Engineer-Challenge/tree/advanced-build)
- [Deployed Advanced Build (Vercel)](https://frontend-jade-iota-75.vercel.app)

#### Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1 Only
Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework:
1. Create a branch of your `AIE7` repo to track your changes. Example command: `git checkout -b s01-assignment`
2. Create a markdown document (for example “ACTIVITIES.md”).
3. Copy the questions into the document.
4. For each question:
    + Answer the “Aspect Tested” question
    + Write up your evaluation of your system’s performance 
5. Answer “Discussion Question #1” at the end of this document.
6. Add, commit and push your new document to your origin repository.
>(NOTE: You should not, merge the new document into origin’s main branch. This will spare you from update challenges for each session.)

When submitting your homework, provide the GitHub link to the new document on the tracking branch you created.

#### Activities, Discussion Questions _AND_ The Advanced Build:
For Activity #1 and Discussion Question #1, follow the same steps as above _**using your Challenge project's repo.**_

When submitting your homework provide the following on the form:
+ The GitHub URL to the markdown document you created in your Challenge project's repo.
+ The public Vercel URL to your updated Challenge project.

### A Note on Vibe Checking

"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.

In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

##### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑❓ Discussion Question #1:

What are some limitations of vibe checking as an evaluation tool?
- It is subjective and depends on individual perceptions.  
- It may overlook subtle flaws that only appear in rigorous testing.  
- It is hard to reproduce results consistently across evaluators.  
- It can miss systematic errors that only emerge with larger data sets.
