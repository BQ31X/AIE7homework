**Subject:** Understanding Student Loans for Low-Income Students

Dear [Customer's Name],

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the impact of student loans on low-income students. We understand that navigating the financial landscape of higher education can be a challenging experience, especially for those from lower-income backgrounds. 

### Overview of Student Loans for Low-Income Students

Student loans play a crucial role in making higher education accessible, but they can also pose financial challenges, particularly for low-income borrowers. Here are a few key points to help you understand the options available and how they relate specifically to low-income students:

1. **Income-Based Repayment (IBR)**: For those who are experiencing financial difficulties, the IBR plan allows borrowers to make payments based on their income. This is particularly beneficial for low-income students, as they may have lower monthly payments, thereby easing financial stress while they progress in their careers. 

2. **Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized Loans**: Low-income students may qualify for subsidized federal loans, which do not accrue interest while the student is enrolled at least half-time. This can significantly reduce the overall debt burden compared to unsubsidized loans, which accrue interest immediately.

3. **Federal Student Aid Eligibility**: The eligibility for certain financial aid programs can vary based on the student's income and family size. Low-income students are encouraged to file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to determine their eligibility for different types of aid, including need-based grants, work-study programs, and loans.

4. **Emergency Relief Measures**: Due to the recent end of COVID-19 relief measures, it's essential for students to be aware that federal student loan interest rates have resumed. Understanding these changes can help low-income borrowers in planning their repayment strategies effectively.

### Conclusion

Access to student loans can provide essential support in obtaining an education, but it is equally important for low-income students to be aware of the repayment terms and available assistance programs. If you require further assistance or have specific questions about your situation, please do not hesitate to reach out.
