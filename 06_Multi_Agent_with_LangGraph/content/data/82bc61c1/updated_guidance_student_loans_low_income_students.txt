### Updated Guidance on Student Loans for Low-Income Students

Dear Valued Student,

As you embark on your educational journey, we wish to provide you with important updates regarding student loans, particularly for those from low-income backgrounds. Understanding your options is critical, especially with recent changes in regulations and support systems.

### 1. **Available Loan Types**
Low-income students can benefit significantly from **Direct Subsidized Loans**, wherein the federal government covers interest while you're in school. In contrast, **Direct Unsubsidized Loans** accrue interest during all periods and are available irrespective of financial need. For more in-depth information, please visit [Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/subsidized-unsubsidized).

### 2. **Changes in Income-Driven Repayment Plans**
With the conclusion of the COVID-19 relief period as of September 1, 2023, student loan payments have resumed. Many students, especially those with lower incomes, may not be aware of alternative payment options. **Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Plans** can help by adjusting monthly payments according to income and family size. Recent court rulings have paused certain changes to these plans, affecting aspects like payment formulas and forgiveness under various plans. For the latest information on these developments, you can visit [Income-Driven Repayment](https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/idr-court-actions).

### 3. **Exploring Financial Aid Options**
Beyond loans, numerous scholarships and additional federal aid programs are available specifically for low-income students. Utilizing tools like the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) can help uncover eligibility for various grants and scholarships. A comprehensive overview is available at [State Financial Assistance Programs](https://mhec.maryland.gov/preparing/pages/financialaid/descriptions.aspx).

### 4. **Conclusion**
While the landscape of student loans is complex, especially for low-income students, a wealth of resources exists to support your educational aspirations without undue financial burden. We recommend reaching out for tailored assistance regarding your financial aid options.
